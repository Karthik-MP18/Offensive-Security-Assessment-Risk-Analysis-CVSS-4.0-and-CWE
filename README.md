# Offensive Security Assessment & Risk Analysis (CVSS 4.0 and CWE)

A hands-on penetration testing portfolio demonstrating vulnerability discovery, exploitation, and risk assessment using CVSS 4.0 and CWE scoring against VulnHub environments. Includes full professional reports.

## üìñ Overview

This repository documents a comprehensive offensive security assessment performed against multiple vulnerable lab environments. The process involved vulnerability discovery, proof-of-concept exploitation, and most importantly a rigorous risk analysis framework using **CVSS 4.0** for scoring and **CWE** for root cause classification.

## ‚ú® Key Activities Demonstrated

-   **Vulnerability Discovery & Reconnaissance:** Utilizing tools like Nmap, metasploit and Burp Suite.
-   **Proof-of-Concept Exploitation:** Safely replicating exploits for known CVEs in isolated environments.
-   **Risk Assessment:** Calculating **CVSS 4.0** environmental scores to quantify business impact and prioritize remediation.
-   **Root Cause Analysis:** Mapping vulnerabilities to **CWE** identifiers to address underlying security weaknesses.
-   **Professional Reporting:** Authoring detailed reports for both technical and executive stakeholders.

## üìä Included Report

The primary deliverable of this assessment is the full penetration test report:
[`Penetration-Test-Report.pdf`](Penetration-Test-Report.pdf)

The report includes:
-   Executive Summary for management.
-   Detailed technical findings for IT teams.
-   CVSS 4.0 vectors and scores for each vulnerability.
-   CWE classifications and root cause analysis.
-   Tailored mitigation and remediation strategies.

## üöÄ How to Use This Repository
